The application was created using React.
The application uses Axios to make an API call to get Popular, Trending and Random movies.
There's a search bar at the top that can be used to search for a movie. The API data is stored as a state and then passed as a prop to a Movie.js class. The data is then accessed and rendered on the screen. To view the firebase page click on https://n00153466moviereactapp.firebaseapp.com/
